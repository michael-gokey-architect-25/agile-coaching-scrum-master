# 18 Leadership Styles for Scrum Masters

A polished guide to leadership models that empower Agile teams, complete with summaries and helpful resources.

---

## 1. Situational Leadership

Situational Leadership, developed by Hersey and Blanchard, asserts that no single leadership style is best. Instead, effective leaders adjust their approach based on the development level of their team members. It's a powerful lens for Scrum Masters, who frequently navigate teams with mixed maturity and motivation levels.

**Resources:**
- [Ken Blanchard's Overview](https://www.kenblanchard.com/Solutions/Situational-Leadership-II)
- [MindTools Guide to Situational Leadership](https://www.mindtools.com/azfl8b4/situational-leadership)

**Key Points:**
- Adapts leadership style to team competence and confidence.
- Flexes between directing, coaching, supporting, and delegating.
- Encourages self-awareness and responsiveness.
- Ideal for Scrum Masters managing new or changing teams.

## 2. Autocratic Leadership

Autocratic Leadership is command-and-control in nature. The leader makes decisions independently and expects compliance. While generally seen as incompatible with Agile, there are moments—such as crises or compliance-heavy environments—where decisiveness matters.

**Resources:**
- [Indeed.com: What Is Autocratic Leadership?](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/autocratic-leadership)
- [Leadership Styles - Lewin’s Framework](https://www.mindtools.com/azfl8b4/leadership-styles)

**Key Points:**
- Decision-making is centralized with the leader.
- Not sustainable in Agile teams long-term.
- Can provide short-term clarity in emergencies.
- Use with caution—can kill motivation and creativity.

## 3. Paternalistic Leadership

Paternalistic Leadership combines authority with care. The leader makes decisions for the team but also takes responsibility for their well-being. It's often seen in traditional, family-like cultures where loyalty is valued.

**Resources:**

- [Emerald Insight Study](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JMD-11-2016-0250/full/html)

**Key Points:**
- Leader acts as a “parent” figure—directive and protective.
- High trust, but limited autonomy.
- Works best with junior or dependent teams.
- May conflict with Agile self-organization principles.

## 4. Democratic Leadership

Democratic Leadership, or participative leadership, emphasizes group input and shared decision-making. Scrum Masters can leverage this style to co-create team norms, working agreements, and solutions, making it a natural fit for Agile.

**Resources:**

- Builds engagement and shared ownership.
- Requires time and psychological safety.
- Ideal for self-managing, cross-functional teams.

## 5. Intent-Based Leadership

Developed by David Marquet, Intent-Based Leadership flips the script: instead of giving orders, leaders encourage others to state their intent. It builds trust, thinking leaders, and shared accountability.

**Resources:**

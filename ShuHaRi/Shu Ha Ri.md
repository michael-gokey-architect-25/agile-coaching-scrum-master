**Shu Ha Ri** is a Japanese concept often used in Agile and martial arts to describe the stages of learning to mastery. It helps teams and individuals understand how skills and behaviors evolve over time. In Agile, it’s especially useful when coaching Scrum Masters, developers, or teams in adopting Agile practices.

Here’s a breakdown:

---

### 🔰 **Shu (守) – Follow the Rules**

* **Meaning:** “Protect” or “Obey”
* **Focus:** Learning the basics by following the rules and established practices without modification.
* **Agile Example:** A team follows Scrum by the book—daily standups, planning meetings, retrospectives, time-boxed sprints.
* **Goal:** Build discipline, structure, and foundational understanding.

---

### ⚔️ **Ha (破) – Break the Rules**

* **Meaning:** “Detach” or “Digress”
* **Focus:** Once the basics are internalized, begin to adapt and evolve beyond strict adherence.
* **Agile Example:** A team experiments with Kanban elements in their Scrum process to improve flow.
* **Goal:** Start innovating within the framework while understanding why it exists.

---

### 🧠 **Ri (離) – Transcend the Rules**

* **Meaning:** “Leave” or “Separate”
* **Focus:** Mastery. You no longer rely on the rules—you understand the principles deeply enough to innovate freely.
* **Agile Example:** A mature team creates a custom blend of Agile practices tailored perfectly to their context and continuously improves it.
* **Goal:** Agility becomes intuitive and principle-driven, not process-bound.


### 🎯 Why It Matters in Agile Coaching:

* **For leaders and coaches:** It helps set realistic expectations based on the learner’s stage.
* **For teams:** Encourages growth from rigid compliance to fluid mastery.
* **For retrospectives:** It’s a great metaphor for team maturity and identifying where growth is possible.
